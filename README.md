**Purpose Of This Script**
This is specifically for recoding the spss portion related to correlation crosstab. Work on the other ones are in the work! Essentially you upload the Posted Q4 pdf as well as the sav with all the survey's question. The script will then extract all of the text that our senior consultants have highlighted and from there a ui will popup allowing you to customize which numbers correlates with what.

From there you then upload the spss related to the trial case so that the script can find the highlighted question within the spss and makes the recoding script.

**Important To Notice**
This only extracts the questions from the plantiff and defense question. This means that you would have to still recode the general question for yourself. This was done as usually these questions are noted by a senior consultant tho
